# JLPKB.github.io
This is a really brief walthrough to remind me how to push / pull from the GitHub repository

Current Local repository is C:// drive on personal laptop with a folder on the desktop
Open **PowerShell** and cd to the root of the JLPKB.github.io folder

**ls** will provide a list of the files / folders inthis directory

**To pull the latest version from Git repository**


**To push the new version to Git repository**
- git status (this will show the status of the files and folders and whether anything has changed from the master. Files that have      changed will be shown in RED
- git add -A (this will stage the new files / folders
- git commit -m "*put a meaningful comment here about what this commit is adding*"
- git push origin master will then push the changes to the git repository. You should be able to refresh the GitHub repo and see a new commit has been added.

Hooray!
